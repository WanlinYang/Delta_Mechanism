# Delta_Function_C_Code

The functions are used for test and demostration on computer terminal.
Functions include inverse, forward kinematics, and Jacobian.

The labeling of the library is illustrated in [Delta_labels.pdf](Delta_labels.pdf).

The data type of variables is double, and the data type for PIC32 is float.
