# Delta Mechanism

In this research project, we aim to build a mobile manipulator with a Delta platform,
which has 3 degrees of freedom in XYZ directions. Here is the video of the robot model

In this repository, we includes kinematics and a control implementation of the Delta platform.
The detailed theoratical analysis is included in the [Thesis](Thesis.pdf)

## Delta MATLAB code

The [Delta_MATLAB_code](/Delta_MATLAB_code) folder has a self-contained MATLAB library of Delta platform.
The code is used to calculate kinematics and plot workspace given parameters of the mechanism.

## Delta C code

## Encoders

## System Demo
