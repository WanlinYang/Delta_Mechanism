# Delta C Code

This library is the C code version of the corresponding MATLAB library.

The following functions are included

* inverse kinematics
* forward kinematics
* Jacobian

Labeling of the library is illustrated in [Delta_labels.pdf](Delta_labels.pdf).

The code is used for testing and demostration on terminal.
The data type of the variables is double, and the data type on PIC32 should be float.
